      <p> How humans connect and shop has evolved significantly over the past several decades; now anyone with an Amazon account can have products from across the world on their doorstep in a matter of days. While the e-commerce systems that make this possible are impressive and beneficial, they also come at a great cost to our Planet’s livelihood. Shipping is projected to account for 10% of all global emissions by 2050, granted that humanity can persevere through the upcoming climate disasters of the next three centuries. Therefore, individual consumers can help lessen their carbon footprint by buying locally and used through the new shippingless-shopping app, BooL. </p> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQUqdbd_buw" target="_blank" role="button" id = "BTN02">Watch Pitch Video <i class="arrow right"></i></a>

        <p class="card-text"> This is why BooL is the future of online shopping, it cuts out the middleman (more like, middlemen) between you and your clothes. With BooL, savvy shoppers can get new shoes, clothes, and even household items with the peace of mind that their purchase hasn’t had detrimental impacts on our shared home. BooL is a buying and selling app where users can browse, purchase, and pick-up antique and vintage items in their area. Users can view nearby items in mapview, filter by distance, price, or seller, and post items for sale through the easy-to-understand interface.<br><br>

            <p class="card-text">The resource that inspired this project was <a href="https://www.disasterassistance.gov/" target="_blank">DisasterAssistance.gov</a>, which is a government site that lets users find valuable information on different disasters and apply for federal aid. During my heurisitic analysis I realized that this site is incredibly flawed and can be difficult to navigate and perform actions with. I wanted to create a new type of resource that includes the valuable information from this site, but with a more intuitive layout and modern design. <br><br>

            This website taught me that there is a deluge of valuable information that could be lifesaving in emergency situations, but that the process of finding and digesting this information is very overwhelming in its current format. My hope in creating this site is to remedy this negative experience by offering streamlined services that can help users confidently make decisions during extremely stressful situations.

            <p class="card-text">

            An important part of the design process is to talk with your users to understand their wants and needs. I conducted a remote interview over Zoom with a target user who lives in the Midwest to gain more insights on how they would approach searching for information regarding a disaster. <br><br>

            This interview taught me a lot about what a user would be looking for in a website like mine and how they would accomplish different tasks. I used techniques like <b>user observation</b> and an <b>interview</b> to ask insightful questions and engage in conversation with the user. Conducting this user research with someone who hasn't experienced many nautral disasters helped me tremendously by giving me perspectives of someone who is completely new to using this type of resource.

            <p class="card-text">
            Storytelling is a critical part of user research and design. I  created <b>user personas</b> and <b>journey maps</b> to help me empathize with my users and better understand situations that would drive them to my website. These tools can provide valuable context that is essential for developing resources to help them achieve their goals.  <br><br>

            These personas and user journey maps were created based on valuable information I gathered from my contextual inquiry. I came up with two personas that were synthesized from the needs identified by the user I interviewed, in addition to my goal of designing the website for middle-aged and older adults living in the United States. Ultimately, I wanted to create these personas and journey maps to better understand the flow of decision-making for these users so I could make their experiences the most efficient and rewarding.

            <p class="card-text">My personas helped me conjure up three key features of the website that I wanted to offer to users: <ul>
              <li>An <b>AI Chat</b> function that allows a user to input data and points them to other parts of the website with real-time answers that are specific to them</li>
            <li>A <b>Check-List Wizard</b> that walks users through important action items to consider in preparation before, during, and after a disaster </li>
            <li>An <b>Evaluation Tool</b> that tells a user how severe their situation is based on their location by using each disaster's unique scientific scales, including the <i>Richter Magnitude Earthquake Scale</i>, <i>Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale</i>, and the <i>Fujita Tornado Scale</i>    </li>
              </ul>
            I wanted this website to present like a government resource, so it was important to design the website to look professional and scientific-based. I tried to avoid using excessive colors that were flashy or unprofessional. These sketches and wireflows helped me come up with a very low-fi prototype. I came up with a few tasks to test with a user:<br><br> <ol>
              <li>Using the AI Chat feature</li>
              <li>Running through an emergency check-list</li>
              <li>Saving an evacuation route</li>
