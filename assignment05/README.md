## ðŸ—º Scenarios & Journey Map

### 1. Jane's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Jane is using this product
> Jane is out to lunch with her family while visiting her 24 yr-old daughter in New York City. She notices her daughter's earrings and can't help but ask where they are from. Her daughter tells her they are from a vintage jewelry dealer in SoHo, but she ordered them through an app. As her daughter goes on about all the amazing sustainable purchases she has made through this app, Jane wants to download it herself. With help from her husband, she successfully downloads the app and makes an account to browse the jewelry.

#### How Jane is using this product
> When first logging on, Jane allowed the app to know her location when she is using the app. Therefore, it only shows products within a 10 mile radius of her location. She wants to narrow down her search to jewelry so she clicks on the 'Jewelry' section of the scrolling home page. Now that shes in 'Jewelry' there are 5 icons across the top, captioned: 'Rings', 'Earrings', 'Bracelets', 'Necklaces', and 'Watches'. She clicks on the earrings icon and then the filter button in the upper right hand corner to specify 'Gold' jewelry. Now she can find gold earrings close to her daughters apartment in New York City, and walk to pick them up during their free day tomorrow.

### 2. Elijah's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Elijah is using this product
> This past weekend, Elijah went to his favorite Sunday Street Market with some of his friends from school. When he was browsing his favorite antique clothing stand, the woman working the stand told him all her inventory is now on an app along with other vendors at the market. Later that week when looking for professional clothing for his upcoming interview, he downloads the app to look for a vintage Tommy Hilfiger button down. 

#### How Elijah is using this product
> After he sets his location, he searches for 'Tommy Hilfiger button down' and several matching products come up as well as suggested products underneath them. In order to see where the products are located he selects 'Map View' in the top left of the screen. From here he changes his radius from 10 miles to 5 miles because he wants to bike to pick up his shirt after class one day. Within his new radius are two Tommy Hilfiger button downs as well as six other button downs. When he selects a clothing location point, a window on the bottom of screen pops up with a picture and information about the shirt, and he can scroll left or right to view more shirts. After he finds his desired shirt, he contacts the seller to set up a pick-up time for tomorrow afternoon.
