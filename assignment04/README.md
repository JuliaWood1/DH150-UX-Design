# Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry

## by Julia Wood for DH 150: User Experience Design

### Central Project Focus Change: General online clothing shopping to sustainable online clothing shopping

I decided to narrow down my project focus from general online shopping to sustainable online shopping to explore if existing sustainable shopping sites meet users  needs. 


## Assignment Overview

#### Design Challenge
The focus of my research is to explore how easy it is for a user to find information regarding the sustainability of clothing they are shopping for. 

#### Target Users
Middle aged women are the user perspective we are designing for throughout this course. In order to understand how this large group of people searches the web for sustainable clothing we have to collect user data from middle aged women of diverse backgrounds. If I had more time to conduct this contextual inquiry research I would interview women of varying professions, races, socio-economic statuses, religions, and more. However, due to COVID-19 I am quarantining with two 20 year old women, so they will have to step in as my users.  

#### Research Method
I will be observing how a user online shops with the goal of sustainability in mind. This will be an observational study where I, the interviewer, prompt the user with a series of questions and record the steps they take to explore my questions. 

#### Contextual Inquiry Description
The inquiry will take place in the user's place of residence. This is because the context of online shopping is normally at home. More specifically the inquiry will take place on a countertop where I can observe and record the user.
