# Assignment 03: Usability Test (UT) Data Analysis

## by Julia Wood for DH150: User Experience Research & Design

In this assignment, I analyzed the data collected during 20 usability test sessions of how people use the UCLA library website (super relevant to me because I work at UCLA Libraries). This assignment allowed me to understand UT data and practice the analysis, so I can utilize these quantitative analysis skills when I am working in the future.

Tasks I completed:
1) Total number of participants
2) Number of participants who completed each task
3) Percentage of participants who completed each task
4) Mean performance time to complete each task, 
5) Mean of perceived difficulty/ efficiency/ likelihood for each task
6) Standard deviation (SD) of Mean performance time for each tasks
7) SD of perceived difficulty/ efficiency/ likelihood rating for each tasks
8) Deviation ratio: Calculate the ratio between the performance time versus the given optimal performance time
9) SUS score
10) Visualization of Desirability test or Production Satisfaction Cards
