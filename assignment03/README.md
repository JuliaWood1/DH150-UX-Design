# Assignmemnt 03: UT Analysis

In this assignment, I analyze the data collected during 20 usability test sessions of how people use the UCLA library website (super relevant to me because I work at UCLA Libraries). This assignment allowed me to understand UT data and practice the analysis, so I can utilize these quantitative analysis skills when I am working with my own UT data in the future.

Tasks I completed:
1) Total number of participants
2) Number of participants who completed each task
3) Percentage of participants who completed each task
4) Mean performance time to complete each task, 
5) Mean of perceived difficulty/ efficiency/ likelihood for each task
6) Standard deviation (SD) of Mean performance time for each tasks
7) SD of perceived difficulty/ efficiency/ likelihood rating for each tasks
8) Deviation ratio: Calculate the ratio between the performance time versus the given optimal performance time
9) SUS score
  - Recode data into 0-6
  - Reverse even_number column data 
  - Average all the data
  - Convert into 100 point system (multiply 100/6)
10) Visualization of Desirability test or Production Satisfaction Cards
  - Lookup( ) to find the adjective that matches the number
  - Use Voyant to visualize the word frequency as a pattern
