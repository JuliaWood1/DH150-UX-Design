### Graphic Design

[Here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/freehand/document/fq1KDPdoR) is where you can find my wireframes that perform three features of my app, Bool. 

**How I chose design elements**: 

When choosing the color scheme for Bool, I wanted it to be bright and fun while also considering those who may have different accessibility needs. At first I started with a pink theme, but I wanted to incorporate more colors. So I went online and browsed some of my favorite websites and apps to get inspiration. Following this I browsed UI Kits online until I found one with all the colors I was looking for: blue, purple, pink, and yellow. The pack additionally included orange, and other darker and lighter basic colors. This pack was perfect for Bool because it was youthful and the contrasts between the light and dark colors met accessibility standards.

All my text throughout is simple black because I wanted the words to be as legible as possible. I chose the avenir next font out of all the available fonts because it was easy to read, and it felt young and fun. This font also  had  many  different available options for bolding and italicizing which I appreciated and utilized.

Based on feedback from my participants in the early stages of designing, I wanted to make my app as easy and familiar to understand as possible. That being said I maintained external consistency throughout my app my putting familiar icons in the right places: the shopping bag in the upper lefthand corner, filter and sort in the upper right of the screen, search bar at the top, bottom naviagtion with home on the left and profile on the right. I also made my main home page a scrolling menu for shoppers to be able to see all the different things available on the site. 

All my main action buttons are purple, and then supplementary action buttons are yellow to maintain internal consistency. Furthermore, I incorporated pop-up windows when the user is progressing through the selling process to prevent users from making mistakes and deleting posts. For the map view, I though it would be most inuitive for a user to click on a pin and then for the item to appear there in a smaller window. Then if the user wants to look more into that item, they can click on it to go to the item listing. 

### Impression Test

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UrwnNYEhCbskTUN56YUEtAHpZJFsfWB3OyzKpY4_7ZM/edit?usp=sharing) is the transcription of the impression test on my sister, Jacqui, a 22 year old woman. 

Before summarizing my findings from the impression test, I want to note that my participant had no prior knowledge of the app. 

Key Takeaways from Impression Test: 
1. She quickly understood that it was a fashion app. 
2. She also learned that it was a nearby app, like facebook marketplace, based on the map view.
3. She loved the welcome page  and logo. 

- Based on the above takeaways, I could gather that she likes the color schema for my app. 

4. She thought the home page was ugly. 

- She did not like the color-blocking home menu scrolling page. She thought it should be a less crowded home page and then with menus that drrop down with submenus. That being said, I will adjust my home page accordingly to make it more aesthetically appealing. 

5. She suggested adding some filtering options, like type of product and tags. 

- I was hoping my menus would make this unneccesary, but after the impression test I think I should all possible filter options rather than excluding them.

6. She did not like the different color pictures. 

- This was a choice I made to make the app stand out and look 'cool'. However, after the impression test Jacqui reaffirmed my worries that this design choice causes confusion and is unnecessary. 

### Accessibility (Color-Contrast) Check 

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ckGiRqhb6I0gJCtucfQgRfHGFJz-BlL6ICJ-2g6NZs0/edit?usp=sharing) is the evidence of completing the accessibility check by comparing the colors of the foreground and background throughout my app, Bool. 

### Evolution of My Design

[Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15if7Rc_BPlxG12zSkgukTOdbV1gDZnFHY60wZikSpzA/edit?usp=sharing) is the link to a slide that shows the evolution of two individual wireframes. 

### Interactive Prototype

coming soon


### Cognitive Walkthroug

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UJISwOpItjyBecNHAT1VfpORAtHAJNlAnirkelwjBgc/edit?usp=sharing) is the feedback I got from my classmates on the cognitive walkthrough of my high fidelity prototype in its beginning stage. 

Based on their feedback these are the changes I implemented:
1. 
2. 



### Reflection

coming soon
