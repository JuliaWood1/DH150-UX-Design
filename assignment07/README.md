# DH150 Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype

## by Julia Wood for Digital Humanities 150 at UCLA, Fall 2020 

### Project Description

coming soon

### Graphic Design

[Here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/freehand/document/fq1KDPdoR) is where you can find my wireframes that perform three features of my app, Bool. 

**How I chose design elements**: 

When choosing my color scheme I wanted it to be bright and fun while also considering those who may have different accessibility needs. At first I started with a pink theme, but I wanted to incorporate more colors. So I went online and browsed some of my favorite websites and apps to get inspiration. I wanted my design to be pleasing to the eye as well as unique. Following this I browsed UI Kits online until I found one with all the colors I was looking for: blue, purple, pink, and yellow. The pack additionally included orange, and other darker and lighter basic colors. Additionally, all my text throughout is simple black because I wanted the words to be as legible as possible. 

Based on feedback from my participants in the early stages of designing, I wanted to make my app as easy and familiar to understand as possible. That being said I maintained external consistency throughout my app my putting familiar icons in the right places: the shopping bag in the upper lefthand corner, filter and sort in the upper right of the screen, search bar at the top, bottom naviagtion with home on the left and profile on the right. I also made my main home page a scrolling menu for shoppers to be able to see all the different things available on the site. 

### Impression Test

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UrwnNYEhCbskTUN56YUEtAHpZJFsfWB3OyzKpY4_7ZM/edit?usp=sharing) is the transcription of the impression test on my sister, Jacqui, a 22 year old woman. 

Before summarizing my findings from the impression test, I want to note that my participant had no prior knowledge of the app. 

Key Takeaways from Impression Test: 
1. She quickly understood that it was a fashion app. 
2. She also learned that it was a nearby app, like facebook marketplace, based on the map view.
3. She loved the welcome page  and logo. 

- Based on the above takeaways, I could gather that she likes the color schema for my app. 

4. She thought the home page was ugly. 

- She did not like the color-blocking home menu scrolling page. She thought it should be a less crowded home page and then with menus that drrop down with submenus. That being said, I will adjust my home page accordingly to make it more aesthetically appealing. 

5. She suggested adding some filtering options, like type of product and tags. 

- I was hoping my menus would make this unneccesary, but after the impression test I think I should all possible filter options rather than excluding them.

6. She did not like the different color pictures. 

- This was a choice I made to make the app stand out and look 'cool'. However, after the impression test Jacqui reaffirmed my worries that this design choice causes confusion and is unnecessary.
