### Introducing Bool: The Future of Sustainable Shopping

Wow, it's been a long time coming, but I can finally say I prototyped my sustainable shopping app, Bool. Yay! So, let me give you an overview of what I have done on this project over the past two week period of high fidelity prototyping. I focused on prototyping three features that I wanted my app to perform: 1) filtering and sorting by price, distance, size, etc., 2) viewing items in Map view, and 3) posting an item for sale on the buying and selling app. While completing these tasks, I also had to add additional helper screens like the entry/loading screen, profiles, likes page, and scrolling main menus. I wish I had more time (and a budget) to devote more time to fully developing this prototype. However, this prototype taught me a lot about how to create a high fidelity  prototype, and what is important to include in the minimum viable product. I also learned that every single time you test the prototype, you will find an minor error that needs fixing (e.g., a missing link or a dead end). I'm looking forward to pitching my app, Bool, to the class next week!

#### Screenshots of Wireframes
In this wireframe you will see the design elements I talk about below.

**How I chose design elements**: 

When choosing the color scheme for Bool, I wanted it to be bright and fun while also considering those who may have different accessibility needs. At first I started with a pink theme, but I wanted to incorporate more colors. So I went online and browsed some of my favorite websites and apps to get inspiration. Following this I browsed UI Kits online until I found one with all the colors I was looking for: blue, purple, pink, and yellow. The pack additionally included orange, and other darker and lighter basic colors. This pack was perfect for Bool because it was youthful and the contrasts between the light and dark colors met accessibility standards.

Most of the text throughout is simple black because I wanted the words to be as legible as possible, however the logo is a dark blue gray color because that is the color I chose for branding. I chose the avenir next font out of all the available fonts because it was easy to read, and I wanted to use a bolded font. This font had  many  different available options for bolding and italicizing which I appreciated and utilized. All my main headers are Bold, Italicized because it looks trendy which matches my desired youthful aesthetic. Then text in the selling process or the filtering process is Black in Demi Bold Italics, so text that is not a header or a main points of contact is easier to read and less aggressive to the eye. Subtitles throughout are in a dark gray color to break up all the black throughout.

Based on feedback from my participants in the early stages of designing, I wanted to make my app as easy and familiar to understand as possible. That being said I maintained external consistency throughout my app my putting familiar icons in the right places: the shopping bag in the upper lefthand corner, filter and sort in the upper right of the screen, search bar at the top, bottom naviagtion with home on the left and profile on the right. I also made my main home page a scrolling menu for shoppers to be able to see all the different things available on the site. 

All my main action buttons are purple, and then supplementary action buttons are yellow to maintain internal consistency. Furthermore, I incorporated pop-up windows when the user is progressing through the selling process to prevent users from making mistakes and deleting posts. I also incorporated a progress bar in the selling process, so the seller can tell how much  longer they have to complete the action of posting an item for sale. For the map view, I though it would be most inuitive for a user to click on a pin and then for the item to appear there in a smaller window. Then if the user wants to look more into that item, they can click on it to go to the item listing. 

### Impression Test

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UrwnNYEhCbskTUN56YUEtAHpZJFsfWB3OyzKpY4_7ZM/edit?usp=sharing) is the transcription of the impression test on my sister, Jacqui, a 22 year old woman. 

Before summarizing my findings from the impression test, I want to note that my participant had no prior knowledge of the app. 

Key Takeaways from Impression Test: 
1. She quickly understood that it was a fashion app. 
2. She also learned that it was a nearby app, like facebook marketplace, based on the map view.
3. She loved the welcome page  and logo. 

- Based on the above takeaways, I could gather that she likes the color schema for my app. 

4. She thought the home page was ugly. 

- She did not like the color-blocking home menu scrolling page. She thought it should be a less crowded home page and then with menus that drrop down with submenus. That being said, I will adjust my home page accordingly to make it more aesthetically appealing. 

5. She suggested adding some filtering options, like type of product and tags. 

- I was hoping my menus would make this unneccesary, but after the impression test I think I should all possible filter options rather than excluding them.

6. She did not like the different color pictures. 

- This was a choice I made to make the app stand out and look 'cool'. However, after the impression test Jacqui reaffirmed my worries that this design choice causes confusion and is unnecessary. 

### Accessibility (Color-Contrast) Check 

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ckGiRqhb6I0gJCtucfQgRfHGFJz-BlL6ICJ-2g6NZs0/edit?usp=sharing) is the evidence of completing the accessibility check by comparing the colors of the foreground and background throughout my app, Bool. 

### Evolution of My Design

### Cognitive Walkthrough

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UJISwOpItjyBecNHAT1VfpORAtHAJNlAnirkelwjBgc/edit?usp=sharing) is the feedback I got from my classmates on the cognitive walkthrough of my high fidelity prototype in its beginning stage. 

Based on their feedback these are the changes I implemented:
1. I removed size as a sort option. My classmates helped me realize it does not truly make sense to sort by size, no one would actually use this feature.
2. I changed the color of the menu buttons on my initial scrolling menu screens. At first glance some of my classmates were confused about the function of these screens; some also thought the text was hard to read on the dark blue background. From their feedback I no longer made that dark blue color a background for anything throughout the app because users may not be able to read the text. 
3. I also made all the clothing display images the same size because my classmates thought the different sizes were confusing. I received the same feedback on my impression test.
