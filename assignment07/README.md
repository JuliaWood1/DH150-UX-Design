### by Julia Wood for Digital Humanities 150 at UCLA, Fall 2020 

#### Project Description

coming soon

#### Graphic Design

[Here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/freehand/document/fq1KDPdoR) is where you can find my wireframes that perform three features of my app, Bool. 

When choosing my color scheme I wanted it to be bright and fun while also considering those who may have different accessibility needs. At first I started with a pink theme, but I wanted to incorporate more colors. So I went online and browsed some of my favorite websites and apps to get inspiration. I wanted my design to be pleasing to the eye as well as unique. Following this I browsed UI Kits online until I found one with all the colors I was looking for: blue, purple, pink, and yellow. The pack additionally included orange, and other darker and lighter basic colors. All my text throughout is simple black because I wanted the words to be as legible as possible. 

#### Impression Test

While analyzing my sister (23 yrs old) interact with my design I noticed several things I could improve in my design.
