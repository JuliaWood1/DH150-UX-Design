# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
# My Project Focus: Women's Retail Sites 
## by Julia Wood for DH150: User Experience and Design

By the end of this class I will prototype an online retail website targeted at middle aged women. To start, I will analyze two potential competitors, Zara and Hautelook: both popular websites for women’s apparel. In order to complete this thorough User Experience analysis, I will be seeing how well each competing site abides by Nielson’s 10 heuristics for User Interface Design. According to an industry professional and UCLA instructor, Dr. Sookie Cho, "The 10 heuristics are a foundational checklist that most UX designers use to communicate the usability issues." My final website will have a minimalist yet colorful design where any user can easily find what they are looking for based on my understandable headers and external consistency. 

#### The two websites I'm analyzing are: 
1. ZARA [Link to ZARA US](https://www.zara.com/us/)

2. Hautelook [Link to Hautelook](https://www.hautelook.com/)

#### Brief Information & Overall Evaluation of each site:
1. ZARA  
ZARA is a fast fashion company which produces clothing modeled off the latest styles in runway fashion. ZARA’s demographic of users ranges from young to old as they sell casual apparel at low cost as well as high-end professional items, like blazers.   
NEED  OVERALL EVALUATION
2. Hautelook  
Hautelook, which is owned and run by Nordstorm, is a retail website that offers daily deals and sales only to their members. Hautelook is more specifically geared towards middle aged women because of the membership policy and the style of clothing.

#### Heuristic Evaluation  
Note: Within each cell there will be a severity rating of how severe the usability issue is pertaining to each of the 10 heuristics on a scale of 1-3, where  3  is the most severe usability problem. The number will be at the beginning of the cell in paranthesis, if I  did  not find a relevant  usability  issue there will be a (0) and I  will explain why  the website  did a good job following the specfic heuristic. 
| Nielson’s 10 Heuristics  | ZARA | Hautelook  | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Visibility of system status <br/> The first heuristic evaluates how well the system shows the user that it understood the user’s action. An example for a shopping website being that when you add something to your cart it updates the number of items within the cart icon. | problem one <br/> problem two <br/> severity rating: 1-3 <br/> (2) When navigating Zara’s site it’s not always easy to tell if the next page is loading or if there is no next page because what you clicked on was not a link. A user should not have to guess what the system is doing, so this is a usability design flaw. However, the site does increment the number of items in the cart when you add something to your cart which is great in terms of system visibility. They also show you what step you are in the checkout process from shipping to payment to summary. | Content Cell  | 
| 2. Match between system and the real world <br/> The second heuristic is that interfaces should mimic the real world experience and speak the users’ language by using simple wording. In regards to online shopping this could mean filtering down to a specific type of clothing, like pants, where in-store a shopper could choose to only look in the pants section of the store.| (3) Zara does not always speak the user’s language, instead they sometimes shorten words by taking out the vowels which is confusing. Some of their headers are confusing too, like ‘Licenses’ which is supposed to describe graphic tees that depict Disney characters.  | Content Cell  | 
| 3. User control and freedom <br/> The third heuristic requires that the interface gives users an undo or escape button, so the user feels comfortable exploring the page knowing that they won’t get stuck on an undesired page. An example being a ‘remove from cart’ option during checkout.| Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 
| 4. Consistency and standards <br/>  The fourth heuristic is that interfaces should strive for similarity to other websites because you want your user to have the easiest possible time navigating your sight. It also means that there should be consistency within the site, like buttons that will take you to a new page should all be the same color, so the user connects the color with action buttons. This means following standard UX conventions like the shopping cart icon being in the upper right hand corner of the page. | (3) Zara’s website can be really hard for a first time user to navigate because it is so dissimilar to the vast majority of online retail sites. The item pictures are not laid out in a grid format but rather a seemingly random format where some rows have 2 images and some have 3 or 4. Additionally the images tend to be different sizes which can be distracting to the user. Some action buttons become underlined when you hover over them (which is good for visibility of system status), but not all action buttons do this so there is little internal consistency. Zara’s attempt to be different can dissuade users from interacting with their site because it is so abnormal.  | Content Cell  | 
| 5. Error Prevention <br/> The fifth heuristic requires that interfaces prevent users from making errors, especially errors that would encourage users to leave the site. This heuristic acknowledges that a user error is really a design flaw, not the fault of the user. An example of this is when a window pops up that asks, “Are you sure you want to remove this item from your cart?”. | (1) I think Zara actually does a good job at error prevention. A popular error made when online shopping is ordering the wrong size. What Zara does to preemptively combat this issue is they offer a sizing help option where you enter your height and weight, and it shows you the percentages of how many people with your same height and weight ordered the item and did NOT return it. Then this is your size on all similar items unless you decide to  change it, so  you cannot accidentally add something to your cart without selecting a size.   | Content Cell  | 
| 6. Recognition rather than recall <br/> The sixth heuristic is that the interface should offer the user context cues, so the user has to rely less on their memory because the system employs options and icons that the user recognizes. In the world of online shopping this can mean showing the user how long until a current deal ends, so they don’t have to remember this information. | Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 
| 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use <br/> The seventh heuristic is that interfaces should offer users multiple ways to achieve the same outcome; this also means including shortcuts for experienced users. An example of this on retail websites, is having a heart icon next to every item so users can continue scrolling while adding clothes they like into a wishlist. This heart icon is a shortcut compared to adding an item to their wishlist by clicking on the specific item and then adding to wishlist or adding an item to a cart and then moving it into the wishlist.| Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 
| 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design <br/> This eighth heuristic guides UX designers towards minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing designs so as to not distract the user from completing their goals. On shopping websites this means focusing on the items for sale and not over-decorating the website to confuse the user. | Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 
| 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors <br/> The ninth heuristic requires that interfaces inform the user when an error has occurred and gives them solutions on how to quickly fix the problem. An example being when a user goes to add a t-shirt to their cart, and the system prompts them to pick a size because the user did not input this information. | (1) Zara’s site does not let users proceed to the next part of the checkout without entering all the relevant information which becomes highlighted in red if the user clicks next without correctly filling it out.   | Content Cell  | 
| 10. Help and documentation <br/> The tenth heuristic recognizes that sometimes the user will need help, and therefore the system should have a help page and/or a tutorial to aid the user in completing their tasks. Some online stores have a chat box that appears in the lower right hand corner asking if the user needs help completing any tasks which is a good example of a website employing this heuristic. | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
