# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
# My Project Focus: Women's Retail Sites 
## by Julia Wood for DH150: User Experience and Design

By the end of this class I will prototype an online retail website targeted at middle aged women. To start, I will analyze two potential competitors, Zara and Hautelook: both popular websites for women’s apparel. In order to complete this thorough User Experience analysis, I will be seeing how well each competing site abides by Nielson’s 10 heuristics for User Interface Design. According to an industry professional and UCLA instructor, Dr. Sookie Cho, "The 10 heuristics are a foundational checklist that most UX designers use to communicate the usability issues." My final website will have a minimalist yet colorful design where any user can easily find what they are looking for based on my understandable headers and external consistency. 


#### The two websites I'm analyzing are:

#### Brief Information & Overall Evaluation of each site:
1. ZARA  
ZARA is a fast fashion company which produces clothing modeled off the latest styles in runway fashion. ZARA’s demographic of users ranges from young to old as they sell casual apparel at low cost as well as high-end professional items, like blazers.   
NEED  OVERALL EVALUATION
2. Hautelook  
Hautelook, which is owned and run by Nordstorm, is a retail website that offers daily deals and sales only to their members. Hautelook is more specifically geared towards middle aged women because of the membership policy and the style of clothing.

## Heuristic Evaluation  
Note: Within each store heuristic evaluation there will be a severity rating of how severe the usability issue is pertaining to each of the 10 heuristics on a scale of 1-3, where  3 is the most severe usability problem. The number will be at the beginning of the analysis in paranthesis, and if there is not a relevant usability issue there will be a (0) and I  will explain why the website did a good job following the specfic heuristic. 


1. **Visibility of system status** : The first heuristic evaluates how well the system shows the user that it understood the user’s action. An example for a shopping website being that when you add something to your cart it updates the number of items within the cart icon.

    - ZARA: (2)  When navigating ZARA’s site it’s not always easy to tell if the next page is loading or if there is no next page because what you clicked on was not a link. A user should not have to guess what the system is doing, so this is a usability design flaw. However, the site does increment the number of items in the cart when you add something to your cart which is great in terms of system visibility. They also show you what step you are in the checkout process from shipping to payment to summary.   
      
    - Hautelook: (2) Hautelook’s main images for several pages are the same, so when clicking through ‘Women’, ‘Men’, ‘All Events’ it may look as though the page isn’t changing at all. The change is only revealed if the user scrolls down and realizes there are different images than on the page before. This can be confusing to the user as one might not be sure if the page is frozen. However, when adding to cart not only do they increment the number of items in the cart, they also show you what's in your cart and the total, which is great. Additionally, when filtering down to specific items it shows you how many are now left based on your filters so you know how many items to expect. The site also puts banners beneath images when there is only  1 left which helps the user know how quickly they have to act. For these reasons, I think they need to make improvements regarding this heuristic, but they do an alright job of explaining the system status to the user.

    
2. **Match between system and the real world** : The second heuristic is that interfaces should mimic the real world experience and speak the users’ language by using simple wording. In regards to online shopping this could mean filtering down to a specific type of clothing, like pants, where in-store a shopper could choose to only look in the pants section of the store.

   - ZARA: (3) ZARA does not always speak the user’s language, instead they sometimes shorten words by taking out the vowels which is confusing. Some of their headers are confusing too, like ‘Licenses’ which is supposed to describe graphic tees that depict Disney characters. Additionally, they leave up items on their page that are sold out which is inconsistent with the real world because you will not be able to see items that are out of stock hanging on the shelves. Here are some pictures: ![alt text](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/Week-1/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-11%20at%205.00.43%20PM.png "ZARA surplus page") ![alt text](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/Week-1/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-11%20at%205.10.02%20PM.png "ZARA Licenses page")

   - Hautelook: (1) I think Hautelook’s website does a great job of using simple and easy to understand language throughout from their headings to checkout. They also use the commonly known cart icon which matches a real world shopping cart. One improvement that could be made regarding this heuristic is credit card visualizations in the checkout process, so the user could see where the numbers correlate to the location on a physical card,  but this is a minor  issue so for that reason the severity rating is only 1.  

3. **User control and freedom** : The third heuristic requires that the interface gives users an undo or escape button, so the user feels comfortable exploring the page knowing that they won’t get stuck on an undesired page. An example being a ‘remove from cart’ option during checkout.

   - ZARA: (0) I think  ZARA’s webpage does a good job at promoting user control and freedom by having return and delete buttons where applicable. In my experience on the site, never has a window popped up that  I cannot close or have I arrived at a page where I couldn’t click back. The user also does not have to make an account to checkout; they have the flexibility to checkout as a guest. 

   - Hautelook: (0) Hautelook is great at giving the user the option to exit a window or return to a previous page. You don’t even need to be a member to use the site or checkout. For these reasons, I did not find that Hautelook violated any parts of the third heuristic. 

4. **Consistency and standards** : The fourth heuristic is that interfaces should strive for similarity to other websites because you want your user to have the easiest possible time navigating your sight. It also means that there should be consistency within the site, like buttons that will take you to a new page should all be the same color, so the user connects the color with action buttons. This means following standard UX conventions like the shopping cart icon being in the upper right hand corner of the page. 

   - ZARA: (3)  ZARA’s website can be really hard for a first time user to navigate because it is so dissimilar to the vast majority of online retail sites. The item pictures are not laid out in a grid format but rather a seemingly random format where some rows have 2 images and some have 3 or 4. Additionally the images tend to be different sizes which can be distracting to the user. Some action buttons become underlined when you hover over them (which is good for visibility of system status), but not all action buttons do this so there is little internal consistency.  ZARA’s attempt to be different can dissuade users from interacting with their site because it is so abnormal. 

   - Hautelook: (0) Hautelook’s website is predictable and learnable because it follows standard UX design practices like having the cart in the upper right hand corner, clearly displaying the name and price of the products below the images, and having the name in the upper left hand corner. It also uses the same colors on buttons which complete similar actions, for example all the navy blue buttons are major action buttons, like ‘Quick Look’, ‘Add to Cart’, and ‘Checkout’. 

5. **Error Prevention** : The fifth heuristic requires that interfaces prevent users from making errors, especially errors that would encourage users to leave the site. This heuristic acknowledges that a user error is really a design flaw, not the fault of the user. An example of this is when a window pops up that asks, “Are you sure you want to remove this item from your cart?”.

   - ZARA: (1) I think  ZARA actually does an okay job at error prevention. A popular error made when online shopping is ordering the wrong size. What  ZARA does to preemptively combat this issue is they offer a sizing help option where you enter your height and weight, and it shows you the percentages of how many people with your same height and weight ordered the item and did NOT return it. Then this is your size on all similar items unless you decide to change it, so you cannot accidentally add something to your cart without selecting a size. However, they also keep items that are totally sold out up on their page without informing the user until they have clicked into it. I gave it a severity rating of 1 because this is just a minor error prevention issue. 

   - Hautelook: (1) The website won’t let the user select sizes that are out of stock and the buttons themselves are muted gray to convey to the user that this size is sold out, which is good error prevention. The best error prevention is having reviews so Hautelook can prevent a big error, processing a return. The review page is helpful because you can read what  other people who bought the product thought of it before you purchase it yourself. However, the system does not alert you when you add the same item to your cart twice, this would be a beneficial addition to confirm that the user actually wants 2 of the same thing. While Hautelook sometimes prevents errors they could make minor changes to their sites to further prevent errors, like returns. 

6. **Recognition rather than recall** : The sixth heuristic is that the interface should offer the user context cues, so the user has to rely less on their memory because the system employs options and icons that the user recognizes. In the world of online shopping this can mean showing the user how long until a current deal ends, so they don’t have to remember this information.

   - ZARA: (1) If you have an email associated with  ZARA, they autofill a lot of the checkout information for you based on your previous purchase information which helps speed up the checkout process. This is relevant to recognition rather than recall because the user does not run the risk of mis-entering personal information, such as address or credit card number. However, they do not have a ‘recently viewed’ resource which can be helpful if users change their mind and want to add something to their cart without having to remember its place on the page or its name. So for these reasons, I think this is a minor sixth heuristic issue. 
   - Hautelook: (1) Hautelook is great at reminding the user that their deals are time sensitive. They do this by highlighting the time left for the deal at the top of the page. However, they do not have a recently viewed resource which would be helpful for users who want to retrieve an item they  looked at without saving to their cart. If they added this feature, then I think they would be perfectly abiding by this heuristic. 

7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use** : The seventh heuristic is that interfaces should offer users multiple ways to achieve the same outcome; this also means including shortcuts for experienced users. An example of this on retail websites, is having a heart icon next to every item so users can continue scrolling while adding clothes they like into a wishlist. This heart icon is a shortcut compared to adding an item to their wishlist by clicking on the specific item and then adding to wishlist or adding an item to a cart and then moving it into the wishlist.

   - ZARA: (1) I think  ZARA does an okay job at abiding by the seventh heuristic because there are multiple ways you can get to the same item and multiple ways you can view all the item photos. The item photos are presented in a column where the user can scroll downwards to see more images, but the user can also tap on the right hand side of the image if this is what they are more familiar with when browsing an image gallery. However, they have no quick look option when scrolling through their page which gives users another way to view items and add them to cart without leaving the main page.  

   - Hautelook: (0) They have a ‘Back to Top’ button which can be really helpful for users who have scrolled so far down and just want to return to the top of the website. You can also access the different deals by scrolling down on the main page or clicking a header which then pops up a window which shows you all the relevant deals. As for saving clothes you liked, a user can easily just hit the heart icon next  to  each image or they can also add it to their cart, but this heart icon is a great accelerator. 

8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design** : This eighth heuristic guides UX designers towards minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing designs so as to not distract the user from completing their goals. On shopping websites this means focusing on the items for sale and not over-decorating the website to confuse the user.

   - ZARA: (1) While yes,  ZARA’s site design is aesthetically minimalistic, it runs the risk of overwhelming the user with the wide variety of how they present their clothes. While scrolling through jackets, there may be a random oversized video of a model wearing a jacket. Thankfully, the video is also clickable to the page where you can look through more images of the jacket and add it to your cart. However, on this site what sometimes appears to be noise in the signal-to-noise ratio is actually signal; this is good only if the vast majority of users understand that it is clickable and not just an aesthetic video. I put this as a minor usability issue because overall the black-and-white design and layout of the website is minimalistic. 

   - Hautelook: (3) Hautelook is the opposite of a minimalist design because they always have about  50 active deals causing the drop-down menus to be overwhelmingly crowded. Below each item page they also have ‘Items you might like’ as well as reviews, which results in the pages being overwhelmingly long. The aesthetic is a little outdated as well, but this does not distract the user from completing tasks, I just  do not particularly like their design choices. 


9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors** : The ninth heuristic requires that interfaces inform the user when an error has occurred and gives them solutions on how to quickly fix the problem. An example being when a user goes to add a t-shirt to their cart, and the system prompts them to pick a size because the user did not input this information.

   - ZARA: (0)  ZARA’s site does not let users proceed to the next part of the checkout process  without entering all the relevant information; they alert the user by highlighting all the missing fields in red. Also when one goes to cart and it is empty, the interface clearly tells the user ‘Your cart is empty’. Additionally, if the user picks a size that  is sold out a window pops up asking them if they want to enter their email so they  can receive a notification when that item  is back in stock. So I found no issues regarding the ninth heuristic.  

   - Hautelook: (2) The only issue I had regarding this heuristic was the lack of communication to a user that an item in their cart is no longer available. After 12 hours of inactivity on the site, I came back to find items missing from my cart. Other websites highlight these no-longer-available items in red to let the user know they are out of stock, whereas Hautelook just removed them from my cart with no messaging. However, Hautelook does inform the user of errors throughout the checkout process by highlighting missing fields in red, communicating to users when a page is missing, and offering solutions to these common errors.


10. **Help and documentation** : The tenth heuristic recognizes that sometimes the user will need help, and therefore the system should have a help page and/or a tutorial to aid the user in completing their tasks. Some online stores have a chat box that appears in the lower right hand corner asking if the user needs help completing any tasks which is a good example of a website employing this heuristic.

   - ZARA: (0)  ZARA’s help page is great and obvious. The ‘HELP’ button is right next to the cart icon so users can easily access any information should they have a question. Within the Help page, a user can learn about the return policy, store location, payment and shipping options, and more.  ZARA’s website also has an accessibility icon where the user can manipulate a myriad of features (like font sizing and coloring) to make their shopping experience more pleasant and understandable. 
   
   - Hautelook: (1)  While Hautelook does have help pages where users can find information relevant to shipping, returns, and more the pages themselves are not easy to find. The action buttons linked to these pages are at the bottom of  pages that seem to scroll forever. These pages are only helpful if users can find them, so just based on the button location this is  a minor usability issue.
