# DH150: User Experience and Design
## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
## by Julia Wood 

### This assignment I will be analyzing two wesbites to find flaws in their user experience by referring to Nielson’s 10 heuristics. According to my professor, Dr. Sookie Cho, "The 10 heuristics are a foundational checklist that most ux designers use to communicate the usability issues."
### The two websites I'm analyzing are: 
1. 
2. 

| Nielson’s 10 Heuristics  | First Website | Second Website  | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
