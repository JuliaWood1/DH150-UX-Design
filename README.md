# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
# My Project Focus: Women's Retail Sites 
## by Julia Wood for DH150: User Experience and Design

By the end of this class I will prototype an online retail website targeted at middle aged women. To start, I will analyze two potential competitors, Zara and Hautelook: both popular websites for women’s apparel. In order to complete this thorough User Experience analysis, I will be seeing how well each competing site abides by Nielson’s 10 heuristics for User Interface Design. According to an industry professional and UCLA instructor, Dr. Sookie Cho, "The 10 heuristics are a foundational checklist that most UX designers use to communicate the usability issues." My final website will have a minimalist yet colorful design where any user can easily find what they are looking for based on my understandable headers and external consistency. 

#### The two websites I'm analyzing are:

2. Hautelook [Link to Hautelook](https://www.hautelook.com/)

#### Brief Information & Overall Evaluation of each site:
1. ZARA  
ZARA is a fast fashion company which produces clothing modeled off the latest styles in runway fashion. ZARA’s demographic of users ranges from young to old as they sell casual apparel at low cost as well as high-end professional items, like blazers.

2. Hautelook  
Hautelook, which is owned and run by Nordstorm, is a retail website that offers daily deals and sales only to their members. Hautelook is more specifically geared towards middle aged women because of the membership policy and the style of clothing.

#### Heuristic Evaluation
| Nielson’s 10 Heuristics  | First Website | Second Website  | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Visibility of system status <br/> The first heuristic evaluates how well the system shows the user that it understood the user’s action. An example for a shopping website being that when you add something to your cart it updates the number of items within the cart icon. | problem one <br/> problem two <br/> severity rating: 1-3 | Content Cell  | 
| 2. Match between system and the real world <br/> The second heuristic is that interfaces should mimic the real world experience and speak the users’ language by using simple wording. In regards to online shopping this could mean filtering down to a specific type of clothing, like pants, where in-store a shopper could choose to only look in the pants section of the store.| Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 
| 3. User control and freedom <br/> The third heuristic requires that the interface gives users an undo or escape button, so the user feels comfortable exploring the page knowing that they won’t get stuck on an undesired page. An example being a ‘remove from cart’ option during checkout.| Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 
| 4. Consistency and standards <br/>  The fourth heuristic is that interfaces should strive for similarity to other websites because you want your user to have the easiest possible time navigating your sight. It also means that there should be consistency within the site, like buttons that will take you to a new page should all be the same color, so the user connects the color with action buttons. This means following standard UX conventions like the shopping cart icon being in the upper right hand corner of the page. | Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 
| 5. Error Prevention <br/> The fifth heuristic requires that interfaces prevent users from making errors, especially errors that would encourage users to leave the site. This heuristic acknowledges that a user error is really a design flaw, not the fault of the user. An example of this is when a window pops up that asks, “Are you sure you want to remove this item from your cart?”.
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 
| 6. Recognition rather than recall <br/> The sixth heuristic is that the interface should offer the user context cues, so the user has to rely less on their memory because the system employs options and icons that the user recognizes. In the world of online shopping this can mean showing the user how long until a current deal ends, so they don’t have to remember this information. | Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 
| 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use <br/> The seventh heuristic is that interfaces should offer users multiple ways to achieve the same outcome; this also means including shortcuts for experienced users. An example of this on retail websites, is having a heart icon next to every item so users can continue scrolling while adding clothes they like into a wishlist. This heart icon is a shortcut compared to adding an item to their wishlist by clicking on the specific item and then adding to wishlist or adding an item to a cart and then moving it into the wishlist.| Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 
| 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design <br/> This eighth heuristic guides UX designers towards minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing designs so as to not distract the user from completing their goals. On shopping websites this means focusing on the items for sale and not over-decorating the website to confuse the user. | Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 
| 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors <br/> The ninth heuristic requires that interfaces inform the user when an error has occurred and gives them solutions on how to quickly fix the problem. An example being when a user goes to add a t-shirt to their cart, and the system prompts them to pick a size because the user did not input this information. | Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 
| 10. Help and documentation <br/> The tenth heuristic recognizes that sometimes the user will need help, and therefore the system should have a help page and/or a tutorial to aid the user in completing their tasks. Some online stores have a chat box that appears in the lower right hand corner asking if the user needs help completing any tasks which is a good example of a website employing this heuristic. | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
