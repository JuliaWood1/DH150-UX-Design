# DH150 Assignment 6: Low Fidelity Prototype

### by Julia Wood for Digital Humanities 150 at UCLA, Fall 2020 


## Overview

**Purpose:** It is so important to first create a low-fidelity prototype of your interface design, so you can pinpoint flaws in your design before you move on to more difficult stages of prototyping. This iterative process of constantly testing and retesting your prototypes ensures that when your creation hits the market, users will innately understand how to navigate your interface. Testing in every step of the development process is crucial to understanding where to make adjustments to your user interface design. 

**Assignment Description:** In this assignment, I will be having my user, Rojin, complete tasks on my paper wireframes. I purposely did not draw my wireflow arrows on this version of the wireframe, so the user has no influence in how they choose to complete the tasks. I identified four tasks I want my user to be able to complete by navigating through the paper wireframes. The four usage scenarios are:    

1. Look at available clothing nearby in Map View  
 
2. Purchase a dress.   

3. Upload clothing to sell.

4. Filter your clothing by location and price.

Throughout completing these tasks she will be checking the usability of three main features: 1) the map view, 2) the purchasing journey, and 3) the posting of an item to sell. 

**User Personas:** The target market for this app are individuals committed to sustainability who want to browse, buy, or sell local and unique items from clothing to furniture. These users are drawn to our app because they want to reduce their carbon footprint by only shopping locally which in turn eliminates shipping from their life. Our users want to shop for a range of products from vintage dresses to antique mirrors all from the comfort of their own home. Our sellers range from antique dealers to college students posting their wardrobes from last season. The interface needs to be understandable from a variety of peerspectives, so I includes use cases from the point of view of a shopper as well as a seller. 



## Wireframes & Wireflows

All wireframes and wireflows can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14I6syQIHZ066PEa7G0XNARaJVJX5WeURCuqU0xHJTFk/edit?usp=sharing).

### Notes on Wireflow Test

**Task 1: Look at available clothing near by in Map View.**
>  When I asked the user to view nearby clothing in Map View she said that she would click on the location tab and circled it in the third wireframe on the upper row. This reaffirmed my belief that it was necessary that the location tab was included in my bottom menu because the user quickly found that feature and immediately understood its use. 

**Task 2: Purchase a dress.**
> When I instructed the user to purchase a dress, she started on the home page and clicked on the clothing tab. From here she correctly added the dress to her cart, and went to checkout. However, when in checkout she navigated the two steps backwards. She first went to payment information and then the pick-up/delivery step of the checkout process. This was surprising to me because they are ordered, but this makes me have to consider if I should reorder the steps of my process so users are more familiar with the order of checkout. 

**Task 3: Upload clothing to sell.**
> As for uploading clothing to sell, Rojin understood that the middle camera icon would enable her to upload photos of clothing or items she wanted to sell. However, I am curious to know if this icon would symbolize the same meaning to users of older ages. While Rojin easily navigated through the process of posting an item to sell, she was confused by it’s ending because she knew there were more steps to the posting process because of the progress bar at the top, but no wireframe did she come next in the flow. For my hard fidelity prototype I will further develop this posting an item to sell feature so a user can complete a full posting.

**Task 4: Filter your clothing by location and price.**
> Rojin initially jumped to the filter wireframe for this test, so I re-directed her to start at the home page, which is the top left wireframe. From here she indicated she would use the search bar to first filter down her search before using the filter and sort options on the second wireframe (first row, second column). This made me consider that maybe I need more specific categories in my initial home page or maybe have another similar scrolling page within each main category of subcategory options such as “shirts”, ‘jackets’, ‘pants’, ‘skirts’ within the clothing tab.


The user successfully completed all components of all of the tasks in this low-fidelity prototype test. Any confusions were explained above.
