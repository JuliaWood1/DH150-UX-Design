# DH150 Assignment 6: Low Fidelity Prototype

### by Julia Wood for Digital Humanities 150 at UCLA, Fall 2020 


## Overview

It is so important to first create a low-fidelity prototype of your interface design, so you can pinpoint flaws in your design before you move on to more difficult stages of prototyping. This iterative process of constantly testing and retesting your prototypes ensures that when your creation hits the market, users will innately understand how to navigate your interface. Testing in every step of the development process is crucial to understanding where to make adjustments to your user interface design. 

In this assignment, I will be having my user, Rojin, complete tasks on my paper wireframes. I purposely did not draw my wireflow arrows on this version of the wireframe, so the user has no influence in how they choose to complete the tasks. I identified four tasks I want my user to be able to complete by navigating through the paper wireframes. The four usage scenarios are:    

1. Look at available clothing nearby in Map View  
 
2. Purchase a dress.   

3. Upload clothing to sell.

4. Filter your clothing by location and price.

Throughout completing these tasks she will be checking the usability of three main features: 1) the map view, 2) the purchasing journey, and 3) the posting of an item to sell. 

The target market for this app are individuals committed to sustainability who want to browse, buy, or sell local and unique items from clothing to furniture. These users are drawn to our app because they want to reduce their carbon footprint by only shopping locally which in turn eliminates shipping from their life. Our users want to shop for a range of products from vintage dresses to antique mirrors all from the comfort of their own home. Our sellers range from antique dealers to college students posting their wardrobes from last season. The interface needs to be understandable from a variety of peerspectives, so I includes use cases from the point of view of a shopper as well as a seller. 



## Wireframes & Wireflows

All wireframes and wireflows can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14I6syQIHZ066PEa7G0XNARaJVJX5WeURCuqU0xHJTFk/edit?usp=sharing).

### Notes on Wireflow Test

**Task 1: Look at available clothing near by in Map View.  **
>  When I asked the user to view nearby clothing in Map View she said that she would click on the location tab and circled it in the third wireframe on the upper row. This reaffirmed my belief that it was necessary that the location tab was included in my bottom menu because the user quickly found that feature and immediately understood its use. 

**Task 2: Purchase a dress.  **
>

**Task 3: Upload clothing to sell. **
>

**Task 4: Filter your clothing by location and price. **
>


The user successfully completed all components of all of the tasks in this low-fidelity prototype test.
