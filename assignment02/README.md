# Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Test
# My Project Focus: Women's Retail Sites 
## by Julia Wood for DH150: User Experience and Design

## Introduction
One paragraph explaining the purpose of UT, how & what you want to test especially based on the findings of heuristic evaluation.  

In this assignment I will be conducting a pilot usability test on the website Hautelook. This is because at the end of this course I hope to design an online shopping experience targetted at middle aged women, and Hautelook is an online retail site used mainly by middle aged women. In Assignment 01, I completed a heuristic evaluation of the website, and I found that the website is difficult to navigate because it is over crowded with the multiude of daily deals. The three main heuristics I will be focusing on in this assignment are:
1. Aesthetic and minimalistic design  
    - I will test this by having the user trying to find a specific deal amongst the 60+ deals that are shown on the site. 
2. Help and documentation  
    - I will test this by having the user find information related to gift returns.  
3. Visibility of system status
    - I will test this by having the user notice differrences between the All Events, Women, and Men pages, as well as filter down items related to a specific criteria and add items to their cart. 

While there were more clear usability issues, like Hautelook removing items from your cart that are no longer in stock with no  messaging or finding an item you viewed previously but didn't save, to test these I would want the user to leave the site and return several hours later which I do not have the luxury to do in this recorded pilot UT.   
The purpose of this Usability Test is to find and correct errors in Hautelook's user experience by having a user attempt to complete tasks on the website. This assignment will help me to analyze the issues with Hautelook's UX, so I do not make similar mistakes in my final project of creating a shopping website. The user testing this is my roommate, Katie, a 20 year old woman very comfortable with online shopping. This is for ease because there are no middle aged women I could get to participate in this usability test free of cost. 

## Survey 
Here is a link to my Hautelook Usability Test made with Google Forms and shared with my instructor, Dr. Sookie Cho.

## Pilot UT Video
Here is the link to my pilot UT video on youtube. It is a screen recording of me, Julia Wood, modereating the Hautelook Usability test (linked above) on my participant, Katie Heckart.  
The video is accessible to anyone with the link.

## Reflection
One paragraph describing what you learned during the pilot test, what went well and what went not so well, focusing on how you want to improve your UT in the future.

I am going to reflect on Katie's experience with Hautelook and the usability test I made. Seeing that Katie is my best friend, I had to pause the recording in the beginning of the video had so I could collect myself because I began to laugh. In the future, with non-friend participants, laughing will not be an issue, however, I wanted to address it here. Now in regards to the test, the first error arose in my questioning of how often she uses the webite. The google form asked the participant, "If yes, how often do you use Hautelook's website?", and Katie had trouble answering this question because she used to use the site frequently, but she has not used it in several years. This made me realize that I need to improve the clarity of my questioning to maybe include how long ago the user last used this website and how often they used the website during the time period when the user frequented the website. The next question from the pre-test questions that I want to highlight is, "What do you think will happen and appear on the website if you select the tab 'MEN'?" This is because I suspected the user would have certain thoughts about it that  differ from how the actual site operates, which is confusing. When one clicks on the 'MEN' tab they do not arrive at 'All men's clothing' like Katie had suspected, but rather they arrive to a lengthy site filled with images for all the events (sales/deals) related to men, not actual Men's clothing.

Now moving onto analyzing how Katie performed the tasks, and what that means in regards to Hautelook's usability based on Nielson'd 10 heuristics.
