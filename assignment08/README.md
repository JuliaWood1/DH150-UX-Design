# Project title
## Design problem statement
### Research: competitor analysis (the original web/app)
- Heuristic evaluation (general usability heuristics), assignment01
  - [read more](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment01/README.md)
- Usability testing & Feedback from the (target) users, assignment02
  - [read more](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment02/README.md)
- Accessibility audits (color contrast)
### Research: re(de)fine the design problem (insights from userâ€™s perspective - desirably with evidence)
- Contextual Inquiry, assignment05
  - [read more](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment05/README.md)
### Design solutions (the NEW design), organize all the sketches and digitized contents
-  Design information structure/architecture (menu tree)
- Design screen structure (wireframes)
- Design the flow/ interaction (wireflow)
  - Heuristic evaluation (with your NEW design)
  - Usability testing & Feedback from the (target) users (with your NEW design)
  - Graphic Designs (multiple variations)
  - Accessibility audits (color contrast) with your NEW design
### Summary of the finding and the plan for the design revision
### Pitch video (for the online presentation)
