## Introduction to the World of E-Commerce

How humans connect and shop has evolved significantly over the past several decades; now anyone with an Amazon account can have products from across the world on their doorstep in a matter of days (or even hours). While the e-commerce systems that make this possible are impressive and beneficial, they also come at a great cost to our Planet’s livelihood. Shipping is projected to account for 10% of all global emissions by 2050, granted that humanity can persevere through the upcoming climate disasters of the next three centuries. Shipping emits air pollutants into our atmosphere, water polutants into our oceans, and greenhouse gases further warming Earth. BooL empowers communities to lessen their carbon footprint by eliminating shipping through shopping locally and used. 

BooL is the shippingless-shopping app of the future. 

## Design Statement: 

BooL is the future of online shopping because it cuts out the middleman (more like, middlemen) between you and your clothes. With BooL, savvy shoppers can get new shoes, clothes, and even household items with the peace of mind that their purchase hasn’t had detrimental impacts on our shared home. BooL is a buying and selling app where users can browse, purchase, and pick-up antique and vintage items in their area. Users can view nearby items in mapview, filter by distance, price, or seller, and post items for sale through the easy-to-understand interface. Thanks to BooL users can shop without guilt!


## Competitor analysis (Heuristic Evaluation and Pilot Usability Test):

Before creating BooL, I analyzed two existing popular retail websites, Zara and Hautelook. In order to complete this thorough User Experience analysis, I checked how well each competing site abided by Nielson’s 10 heuristics for User Interface Design. According to an industry professional and UCLA instructor, Dr. Sookie Cho, "The 10 heuristics are a foundational checklist that most UX designers use to communicate the usability issues." 

What I found from this analysis is that ZARA’s unique website does not adhere to several industry standard UX practices which results in users being confused and frustrated when navigating their site. On the other end of the spectrum, Hautelook’s design is rather simplistic and boring which could deter younger users from interacting with it at all. BooL fits in the perfect sweet spot of intriguing yet intuitive interface design, so all users can navigate the app with ease and pleasure.

## User Research (Contextual Inquiry):

Before I dove into designing my sustainable shopping experience, I wanted to understand how the average person might first find sustainability information regarding the clothes they are shopping for. So I conducted a contextual inquiry interview with my  roommate, Katie Heckart. In this conversation I had her show me how she would research a company’s sustainability practices, find how an individual product is made, and how she would filter through this information to find what is most important to her. From this, I learned what makes people trust brands’ sustainability information, and that buying used and local is the best way to practice sustainable shopping. 

**Important** This contextual inquiry changed the focus of my project from a general shopping app to a sustainable one, and you can read more  about it [here](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment04/README.md). 




## UX Storytelling (Understanding Your Users)

In this step of the design process, I wanted to fully understand my future users and more specifically what motivates them to shop sustainably. Therefore I created two user personas: Jane and Elijah. Jane was a middle aged mom to two grown children who was motivated to shop sustainably by her daughter.  Elijah was a busy college student who was already committed to sustainable shopping practices, but wanted to try out a new platform. Through creating empathy maps, scenarios, and journey maps for each of these personas I gained valuable insights about the potential users for my app, BooL. It's so important to understand your user before you design an experience for them. When designers do not take the time to truly understand what motivates their user they can miss important aspects that will encourage users to interact with their design.

Below you will see the full user persona of Jane. 


You can see both of my user personas [here](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment05/README.md).

## Wireframe and Graphic Design Elements

When beginning to create my app, I thought of the three most essential features I wanted my shopping app to have. After careful consideration, I chose my three features to be: 

1. filtering and sorting by price, distance, size, etc., 
2. viewing items in Map view, and
3. posting an item for sale on the buying and selling app. 

Therefore I had to create enough wireframes so my prototype could walk through these three use cases. Furthermore, I also had to choose my specific design elements, like color, font, layout, icons, and more. When choosing the design components for Bool, I knew I wanted the app to be bright and fun while also considering those who may have different accessibility needs. For these reasons I chose a youthful color scheme but kept my font visible and black throughout. I  will link the accessibility (color-contrast) check where I compare the the foreground and background colors [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ckGiRqhb6I0gJCtucfQgRfHGFJz-BlL6ICJ-2g6NZs0/edit?usp=sharing).

**Important** Throughout the design process, my ideas took many different forms, and you can view the evolution of my design by focusing on two different wireframes [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15if7Rc_BPlxG12zSkgukTOdbV1gDZnFHY60wZikSpzA/edit?usp=sharing). 

You can read more about how I chose my specific design elements [here](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment07/README.md).


## Low-fidelity Prototype 

The low fidelity part of the project was actually the most difficult step for me. This is because you have to create your designs from scratch, whereas in the later design phases you can just tweak your initial low-fidelity wireframes. It is so important to first create a low-fidelity prototype of your interface design, so you can pinpoint flaws in your design before you move on to more difficult stages of prototyping. This iterative process of constantly testing and retesting your prototypes ensures that when your creation hits the market, users will innately understand how to navigate your interface. 

Not only did I create [low-fidelity wireframes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14I6syQIHZ066PEa7G0XNARaJVJX5WeURCuqU0xHJTFk/edit?usp=sharing), linked here. 

I also tested them on a potential user, to see how I could improve my interface. The key takeaways from this wireflow test were: 
1. To implement more submenus, so users can easily narrow down their initial search. 
2. Re-order the screens throughout the selling process in a  way that is more initutive to users.

## High-fidelity prototype

#### Testing of High-fidelity prototype
**Impression Test**

**Cognitive Walkthrough**
[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UJISwOpItjyBecNHAT1VfpORAtHAJNlAnirkelwjBgc/edit?usp=sharing) is the feedback I got from my classmates on the cognitive walkthrough of my high fidelity prototype in its beginning stage.

Based on their feedback these are the changes I implemented:

1. I removed size as a sort option. My classmates helped me realize it does not truly make sense to sort by size, no one would actually use this feature.
2. I changed the color of the menu buttons on my initial scrolling menu screens. At first glance some of my classmates were confused about the function of these screens; some also thought the text was hard to read on the dark blue background. From their feedback I no longer made that dark blue color a background for anything throughout the app because users may not be able to read the text.
3. I also made all the clothing display images the same size because my classmates thought the different sizes were confusing. I received the same feedback on my impression test.

## Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?

**Steep Learning Curve for InVision** When I first started prototyping in InVision, I couldn't even figure out how to move an icon. Eventually, I got more and more robust at making changes to my design. By the end I created 50 different screens all successfuly linked together. This took me a long time, but it was necessary to fully implement my three use cases. 

**Necessity for User Feedback** Throughout the whole process the user feedback was crucial to determine what was working and what needs changing. Based on the users input, I changed the focus of my app from a regular shopping app to a sustainable shopping app that's looking towards the future rather than the past. Furthermore, I also changed the entry screen, main scrolling menu, the shapes of the clothing images and more.
