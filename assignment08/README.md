# Bool: The Future of Sustainable Shopping by Julia Wood
## Introduction a brief information about the project. 
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.
## Clear design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 
## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the *existing* product(s) - or the *original* website you evaluated

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
Summary and link to your assignment folder
- [read more](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment04/README.md)
- Accessibility audits (color contrast)
## UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
Summary and link to your assignment folder

## Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)
## High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype
## Optional evaluation and revision history 
Including cognitive walkthrough; impression test, accessibility audit, usability testing), per each summary and link to the notes (when you share the video or other detailed evidences, I will notify you when you can make the contents private as soon as your work is graded)
## Pitch video 
## Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?


### Research: competitor analysis (the original web/app)
- Heuristic evaluation (general usability heuristics), assignment01
  - [read more](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment01/README.md)
- Usability testing & Feedback from the (target) users, assignment02
  - [read more](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment02/README.md)
- Accessibility audits (color contrast)
### Research: re(de)fine the design problem (insights from userâ€™s perspective - desirably with evidence)
- Contextual Inquiry, assignment05
  - [read more](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment05/README.md)
### Design solutions (the NEW design), organize all the sketches and digitized contents
- Design information structure/architecture (menu tree)
- Design screen structure (wireframes)
- Design the flow/ interaction (wireflow)
  - Heuristic evaluation (with your NEW design)
  - Usability testing & Feedback from the (target) users (with your NEW design)
  - Graphic Designs (multiple variations)
  - Accessibility audits (color contrast) with your NEW design
