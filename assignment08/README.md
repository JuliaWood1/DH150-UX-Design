## Introduction to the World of E-Commerce

How humans connect and shop has evolved significantly over the past several decades; now anyone with an Amazon account can have products from across the world on their doorstep in a matter of days. While the e-commerce systems that make this possible are impressive and beneficial, they also come at a great cost to our Planet’s livelihood. Shipping is projected to account for 10% of all global emissions by 2050, granted that humanity can persevere through the upcoming climate disasters of the next three centuries. Therefore, individual consumers can help lessen their carbon footprint by buying locally and used through the new shippingless-shopping app, BooL. 

## Design Statement: 

This is why BooL is the future of online shopping, it cuts out the middleman (more like, middlemen) between you and your clothes. With BooL, savvy shoppers can get new shoes, clothes, and even household items with the peace of mind that their purchase hasn’t had detrimental impacts on our shared home. BooL is a buying and selling app where users can browse, purchase, and pick-up antique and vintage items in their area. Users can view nearby items in mapview, filter by distance, price, or seller, and post items for sale through the easy-to-understand interface.


## Competitor analysis:

Before creating BooL, I analyzed two existing popular retail websites, Zara and Hautelook. In order to complete this thorough User Experience analysis, I checked how well each competing site abided by Nielson’s 10 heuristics for User Interface Design. According to an industry professional and UCLA instructor, Dr. Sookie Cho, "The 10 heuristics are a foundational checklist that most UX designers use to communicate the usability issues." 

What I found from this analysis is that ZARA’s unique website does not adhere to several industry standard UX practices which results in users being confused and frustrated when navigating their site. On the other end of the spectrum, Hautelook’s design is rather simplistic and boring which could deter younger users from interacting with it at all. BooL fits in the perfect sweet spot of intriguing yet intuitive interface design, so all users can navigate the app with ease and pleasure.

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:

Before I dove into designing my sustainable shopping experience, I wanted to understand how the average person might first find sustainability information regarding the clothes they are shopping for. So I conducted a contextual inquiry interview with my  roommate, Katie Heckart. In this conversation I had her show me how she would research a company’s sustainability practices, find how an individual product is made, and how she would filter through this information to find what is most important to her. From this, I learned what makes people trust brands’ sustainability information, and that buying used and local is the best way to practice sustainable shopping. This assignment changed the focus of my project from a general shopping app to a sustainable one, and you can read more  about it [here](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment04/README.md).
