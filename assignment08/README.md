## Introduction a brief information about the project. 
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.

Wow, it's been a long time coming, but I can finally say I prototyped my sustainable shopping app, Bool. Yay! So, let me give you an overview of what I have done on this project over the past two week period of high fidelity prototyping. I focused on prototyping three features that I wanted my app to perform: 1) filtering and sorting by price, distance, size, etc., 2) viewing items in Map view, and 3) posting an item for sale on the buying and selling app. While completing these tasks, I also had to add additional helper screens like the entry/loading screen, profiles, likes page, and scrolling main menus. I wish I had more time (and a budget) to devote more time to fully developing this prototype. However, this prototype taught me a lot about how to create a high fidelity  prototype, and what is important to include in the minimum viable product. I also learned that every single time you test the prototype, you will find an minor error that needs fixing (e.g., a missing link or a dead end). I'm looking forward to pitching my app, Bool, to the class next week!

This app  allows users to look at vintage and used clothes as well as antique items in their area. Shippping and transportation in general has a huge negative effect on the  environment, and with Bool there's no shipping. Bool cuts out the  middle man between you and your clothes, therefore  helping the environment! The clothing  you  can view on the app is within a certain radius (that you can change), so you can walk/bike/drive to pick up your items. 

## Clear design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

Sustainability paragraoh. 
## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the *existing* product(s) - or the *original* website you evaluated

## Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?


### Research: competitor analysis (the original web/app)
- Heuristic evaluation (general usability heuristics), assignment01
  - [read more](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment01/README.md)
- Usability testing & Feedback from the (target) users, assignment02
  - [read more](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment02/README.md)
- Accessibility audits (color contrast)
### Research: re(de)fine the design problem (insights from user’s perspective - desirably with evidence)
- Contextual Inquiry, assignment05
  - [read more](https://github.com/JuliaWood1/DH150-UX-Design/blob/master/assignment05/README.md)
### Design solutions (the NEW design), organize all the sketches and digitized contents
- Design information structure/architecture (menu tree)
- Design screen structure (wireframes)
- Design the flow/ interaction (wireflow)
  - Heuristic evaluation (with your NEW design)
  - Usability testing & Feedback from the (target) users (with your NEW design)
  - Graphic Designs (multiple variations)
  - Accessibility audits (color contrast) with your NEW design
